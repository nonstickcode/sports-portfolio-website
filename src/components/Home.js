              My goal is to wrestle at a prestigious collegiate program while
              pursuing my academic passions at an exceptional school.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              I fell in love with wrestling the first time I stepped onto the
              matâ€”it is an incredible sport! I am a determined, well-rounded
              competitor who is both offensive and defensive. I value input from
              coaches and teammates, and I work hard to apply what I learn in
              every match. I am a team player who challenges myself to improve,
              always striving to set a positive example through leadership.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Despite dedicating significant time to excel in wrestling, I have
              consistently maintained high academic performance. I particularly
              enjoy problem-solving and thrive in challenging academic
              environments, where I am committed to pushing myself toward
              excellence both on the mat and in the classroom.
